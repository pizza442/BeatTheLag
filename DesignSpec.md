## Problem Statement
While one of our group members was coming back from vacation they had a really hard time adjusting to be back in the normal way of things. They had just come from a country that was fourteen hours ahead of the time here in Seattle. So night time in Seattle meant day time in the respective country vice versa. So when our team member got back they were completely out of sync with the time difference. That’s when jet lag came into play causing our team member to unintentionally fall asleep in class and miss out on important material. Jet lag, is a sleeping disorder caused by a mismatch between our body’s natural circadian rhythm and an external environment, is a problem for lots of travelers around the world as the sudden change in time zones bring a heavy toll onto our bodies. This introduces sleeping problems that lead to a decrease in productivity as well as many, potentially long-lasting, health concerns. According to the following study, the symptoms of jet lag “may include disturbed sleep, daytime fatigue, decreased ability to perform mental and physical tasks, reduced alertness, and headaches”. The possible long-term consequences can cognitive deficits, heart disease and even increase the risk of getting cancer.  
In the time which technology is sufficient enough to solve an issue like this, the traveler shouldn’t suffer from this problem.  
That’s why their ought to be a way that helps people get their sleep by operating on a given sleep schedule

## Solution:
We have decided to solve this problem through an online application that we have called BeatTheLag, which helps users create a sleeping schedule that would aid in negating the effects of jet lag through mindful sleeping techniques.

### How it works:  
Users will log in with their Google account and input the information about their flight and sleeping schedule. Using scientific data on the effects of traveling on circadian rhythms, sleep and jet lag, BeatTheLag will create a custom schedule for the user. This optimal sleep schedule would mitigate the effects of jet lag and provide the option to import this schedule to the users Google Calendar.

With BeatTheLag, you can create your own personalized jet lag plans and arrive at your best. Whether you’re traveling for business, going on vacation, or competing in a sports event abroad, BeatTheLag will help optimize your performance, enjoyment, and health when traveling.
